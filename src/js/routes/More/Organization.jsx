          We Vote is building the next generation of voting tech. We're creating a digital voter guide
          informed by issues you care about and people you trust. Through our nonpartisan, open source platform,
          we'll help you become a better voter, up and down the ballot.<br />
          <br />
          You have a lot of decisions to make when you vote, and political campaigns don't always tell the
          whole truth. With fake news and misinformation, it's hard to tell which candidate or ballot initiative
          is on your side. Does that candidate for state legislature care about the same issues that you do?
          Does the awkwardly-worded ballot initiative support what you believe or is it the exact opposite
          (and was it purposely written to be so confusing?!)<br />
          <br />
          We Vote cuts through the clutter to help you understand what's on your ballot.
          Our open platform empowers voters to create and share voter guides that aggregate information
          and opinions across personal networks. So you can help your friends be better voters too.<br />

          <h3 className="h3">A Nonprofit Startup</h3>
          We Vote is a nonpartisan nonprofit organization (501(c)(3) based in
            Oakland, California. Inspired by groups like
          <OpenExternalWebSite url="http://codeforsanfrancisco.org/"
                               target="_blank"

          and the
          <OpenExternalWebSite url="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/foundation/"
                               target="_blank"

                               body={<span>Mozilla Foundation&nbsp;<i className="fa fa-external-link" /></span>} />
          , we use free and open source software to
          make democracy stronger by providing education about what is on your ballot.<br />

          <h3 className="h3">Our Story</h3>
          After meeting in Oakland in the spring of 2012, We Vote co-founders Dale McGrew, Jenifer Fernandez Ancona, Dan Ancona,
          and their families became fast friends and bought a home together,
          forming an intentional community. Through
          daily conversations, the idea of a nonprofit social voter network was born.
          &quot;We&#39;re living our values,&quot; says Jenifer. We Vote would be a community for voters, they
          decided, created
          from a communal home of people concerned about where this country is heading. Being an open
          source, volunteer-driven project means anyone can contribute. Kind of like democracy.<br />
